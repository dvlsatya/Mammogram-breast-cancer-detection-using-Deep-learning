**What is Breast Cancer?**
Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled, chaotic way. The cells keep on proliferating, producing copies that get progressively more abnormal. In most cases, the cell copies eventually end up forming a tumor.

Breast cancer occurs when a malignant (cancerous) tumor originates in the breast. As breast cancer tumors mature, they may metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body. The primary route of metastasis is the lymphatic system which, ironically enough, is also the body's primary system for producing and transporting white blood cells and other cancer-fighting immune system cells throughout the body. Metastasized cancer cells that aren't destroyed by the lymphatic system's white blood cells move through the lymphatic vessels and settle in remote body locations, forming new tumors and perpetuating the disease process.

Breast cancer is not just a woman's disease. It is quite possible for men to get breast cancer, although it occurs less frequently in men than in women. Our discussion will focus primarily on breast cancer as it relates to women but it should be noted that much of the information is also applicable for men.


**Methodology**
The general workflow for developing a deep learning-based classification model for mammography-based
breast cancer diagnosis typically involves the following steps: Data Import: The first step is to import the
mammography image dataset into the deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Data
Preprocessing: The next step is to preprocess the mammography images, which may involve techniques such
as normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance the quality and quantity of the dataset.
Segmentation: Segmentation is the process of identifying and separating relevant structures or regions within
the mammography images. This step is crucial for accurately identifying the areas of interest that are
indicative of breast cancer. Training: Once the dataset has been preprocessed and segmented, the next step is
to train the deep learning model using the training set. This involves optimizing the model's parameters and
hyperparameters using backpropagation and gradient descent. Validation: After the model has been trained, it
is validated on a separate validation set to evaluate its performance and adjust the model's hyperparameters.
Testing: Finally, the performance of the trained deep learning model is evaluated on a separate testing set to
assess its accuracy and effectiveness for mammography-based breast cancer diagnosis.
